"""
The goal of this module to combine using the Pixy with the drive motors.  You will track a color using the Pixy and turn
the robot so that it is always facing the color signature.  You will need to teach Pixy a color before starting to
implement the code, then make the robot always face the color as you move it around.  The robot will only spin and never
move forwards or backwards.
